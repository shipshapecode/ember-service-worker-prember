[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-service-worker-prember.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ember-service-worker-prember)

An Ember Service Worker plugin that caches the html files from your static Ember app generated by [prember](https://github.com/ef4/prember)

## F#$& my assets aren't updating in development mode

Turn on the "Update on reload" setting in the `Application > Service Workers`
menu in the Chrome devtools.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-service-worker
ember install ember-service-worker-prember
```

## Configuration

Configuration is optional. You should not need to manually bust the cache.
This addon now finds all `index.html` files and makes a hash of the contents.
It will constantly check if this hash gets out of date, and switch the files for you.
If things seem to be broken, you can try manually bumping the version.

```js
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    'esw-prember': {
      // Changing this version number will bust the cache, but you probably do not
      // want to be doing this manually, but rather using `versionStrategy` as
      // explained here http://ember-service-worker.com/documentation/configuration/#versioning
      version: '1'
    }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```
